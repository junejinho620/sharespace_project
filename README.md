# ShareSpace â€“ AI-Powered Roommate Matching Platform

Finding a compatible roommate is harder than it should be. Profiles on existing platforms are often shallow, and matching is random at best. My friend and I started **ShareSpace** with the belief that living situations shape not just comfort but also productivity and wellbeing â€” and that better matching leads to better lives.

Our **mission** is to build a safe and intelligent roommate discovery platform: one that combines AI-driven compatibility with reliable verification and a smooth user experience. Our **vision** is to make roommate searching as transparent and stress-free as finding a playlist you love â€” informed by your personality, lifestyle, and preferences.

## ðŸš€ Overview

ShareSpace is a full-stack web platform that:
- Captures **detailed lifestyle preferences** through onboarding forms.  
- Uses **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)** to analyze and compare user profiles for semantic similarity.  
- Provides a **real-time chat** system so matched users can connect immediately.  
- Plans to integrate **identity verification** and **insurance partnerships** for trust and safety.  

This project is both a technical exploration and a product experiment: blending backend engineering, AI microservices, and UX design into a deployable service.
